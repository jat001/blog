Let's be clear. I don't like talking with strangers. And I definitely hate interviews. The only reason I'm here is because I need a job to make money. If I'm a rich guy, you will never see me.

I must admit that I didn't read the job description carefully before applying for a job. It is hard to find a good job in the current economy. Nobody will pay me for reading a JD. Reviewing and filtering the resumes are HR's job. But a lots of HRs cannot do it properly. They don't know what kind of people are needed for this job. They found some keywords on the CV that matched with JD and booked an interview. Anyone can do this simple work. So now I won't accept any interview that requires me to be physically present at the office during the first interview.

I do read the JD before an interview. However, many interviewers won't look over my CV in advance. If you want to waste both of our time, fine, fuck youüñï.

Again, although most of the teams I've worked with before were building AI products. I still know nothing about AI algorithms. I'm not good at maths. I have never used any algorithms in my pervious work. I can write an API. I can read RFCs. Yet I can't build an AI model. I can't understand a paper that contains formulas.

I am a computer programmer, not an algorithm engineer, nor a data scientist. I think the most significant difference between programmers and the others is that good programmers focus on writing elegant code. For algorithm engineers and data scientists, coding is just a tool. That doesn't mean I don't respect their work. In fact, many programmers, including myself, have no idea how artificial intelligence works. So I do respect their work. And I would appreciate it if they could respect mine.

Besides elegant code, programmers also need to focus on writing complex business logic. That is basically CRUD. Yeah, it's boring. As an algorithm engineer or data scientist, you might think it's easy. I'm not going to pretend it's difficult. I don't like it either. But it's my job, please respect it. And blame the HR who booked the interview.

Please don't tell me which framework I should learn. If you want to hire me, I will learn everything I need to know to get the work done. If you don't want to hire me, why should I waste my time learning a framework that I may never use again. The frameworks written by my previous team are also open source projects. Are you interested in learning them?

Please don't give me any tests that take more than an hour to complete. Hard to find a good job doesn't mean I will work for free.

Do not question my professional abilities. Anybody who has worked with me would agree on this.

If you don't like my style. That's OK. Feel free to throw my resume in the trash. I seriously don't care. And please do not give me any advice. No one likes taking advice from strangers.

Believe it or not, I only received the nine-year compulsory education. Programming is self-taught.

Remember, talk is cheap, show the code.
