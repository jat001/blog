[![which-is-the-best-code-editor](http://bcs.duapp.com/sinosky-blog/2013/02/22/2306.jpg)](http://bcs.duapp.com/sinosky-blog/2013/02/22/2306.jpg "which-is-the-best-code-editor")

For us, web developers, the choice of a source code editor shouldn’t come lightly. This is where we spend most of our development time and where productivity is gained or lost on a grand scale. No two developers are alike, so there is a plethora of editors that can accommodate any coding style. But this politically-correct statement doesn’t answer the most fundamental question of all – **which is the best**?

To determine the best editor, we will rate each one on a scale from 1 to 5 stars, consisting of:

*   **Beginner friendliness** – how easy it is for a beginner to get up and running when opening it for the first time;
*   **Power** – this criteria rates the feature set, text editing capabilities, editing modes etc.
*   **Extensibility** – does the editor supports plugins, bundles or extensions;
*   **Aesthetics** – we strive for beauty in our work, so it is natural to look for the same in our tools;
*   **Speed** – this rates the startup time, performance when opening large files, snappiness of the interface;
*   **Cross-platform** – if the editor is available on multiple operating systems.
*   **Price** – the lower the cost, the higher the mark.

Editors are presented in groups, giving some context on the typical type of developer that would use them.

### For Gurus

Who is a guru you ask? Generally, this is a person who has been using one of the editors below since before you were born. The tools in this section are hardcore and insanely expandable. They can run from a terminal window and according to UNIX traditions all their settings are defined in configuration files. Beginners beware!

#### Vim

Released in 1991 this versatile and powerful editor gained a massive following in the open source world. What makes it different from any other editor in this article, is its command-based workflow. Instead of simply typing code, you choose between modes for entering or selecting text, running regex-powered searches and using more commands than you can handle on an empty stomach. It can run from both a console window and a GUI. It has also been ported to all major operating systems. Vim is also extendable by using scripts and plugins, which allow you to tailor your experience with the editor. It is open source software and comes preinstalled on most Linux systems.

#### Emacs

Development of Emacs started way back in the 1970 and _continues to this day_. This editor is known for its extensibility, achieved by loading customized libraries. It deserves its place in computing history, as it is one of the first editors to implement syntax highlighting, automatic indentation and support for multiple programming languages. Like Vim, it is perfectly cross-platform and can be used from both a terminal window and through a graphical user interface. The editor comes bundled with a LISP interpreter, which gurus can use to change it to extremes. Emacs is free and open source software.

### For Professionals

The editors in this category are full blown development environments. They are meant to be easy to use and at the same time expose powerful features so that developers go through writing code, compiling, testing and deploying from a single application.

#### Eclipse

Eclipse is the goto development environment for writing Java applications. The IDE follows a plugin architecture, which makes it easy to bring support for additional programming languages. There are plugins for C/C++, Ruby, PHP and more. Eclipse offers powerful code hinting, built in documentation and real-time syntax checking. Companies like Google release their development kits for the platform, so you can easily create applications for Android and App Engine. Eclipse is free and open source.

#### Aptana Studio

Aptana is a development environment targeted at rich AJAX applications. It is based on Eclipse, and bundles powerful new tools that make sense for web developers. It has support for the most popular web programming languages: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Python and more through plugins. It has Git integration, ability to deploy your application to remote servers and bundles of useful code snippets and actions for every language. Like Eclipse, Aptana is free and open source.

#### Netbeans

Netbeans is another Java development environment, but like Eclipse, can be extended with bundles for additional languages including PHP, Python, C/C++ and others. It runs on Linux, Windows and OSX. Where this IDE shines though, is in Java development. Netbeans can speed up your development of desktop applications with a drag&amp;drop GUI builder. A negative side effect of all this flexibility is the performance – Netbeans has frequently been reported for being slow on large projects. The IDE is free and open source.

#### Dreamweaver

Dreamweaver is part of Adobe’s application suite targeted at web designers/developers. It provides support only for the most popular web languages – PHP, ASP.NET,  JavaScript, HTML, CSS. It is mainly suitable for beginner developers, with support for WYSIWYG editing, live previews, deployment to remote servers and building apps with jQuery mobile and Phonegap. Dreamweaver is available on OSX and Windows. With a standalone price tag of $399 it is hard to recommend in place of the other editors in the article, but buying it as part of Adobe’s CS suites might make more sense.

#### Visual Studio

Visual Studio is the all-in-one development environment for Windows. It supports a large number of languages (C/C++, C#, VB.NET and F# come built-in)  and can be used to develop applications for desktop, mobile and web.
